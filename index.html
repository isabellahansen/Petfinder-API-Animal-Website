                            <strong>Volunteers</strong> are essential to Quechee's Pet Pals ability to achieve its mission. We rely on volunteer assistance at our Center to help us provide a high quality of life to our adoptable animals as they wait for a home. There are many volunteer duties which directly help the animals we are caring for including walking or taking them to our play yards for exercise. Volunteers may also assist in educational outreach, fundraising events, laundry, off-site pet adoptions, training sessions with new volunteers, and animal enrichment programs!
                            Quechee's Pet Pals volunteers help fulfill the organization’s mission to provide a second chance for animals that have been abused, neglected or abandoned.
                             Our volunteers are committed to furthering that mission by supporting our staff, programs and events dedicated to providing humane treatment, improved quality of life and placement into forever homes for the animals in our care.

                            Becoming a foster parent at Quechee's Pet Pals is one of the most helpful, heartfelt things you could possibly do for a homeless companion animal. As a foster, you provide a temporary loving home for an abandoned dog or cat until he or she finds a forever home. Many of those we rescue have lived difficult lives on harsh city streets, and fosters are essential to showing these animals what it means to trust, feel safe, and experience comfort. Whether your foster is with you for several days or several months, the knowledge that you helped immensely will last a lifetime.
